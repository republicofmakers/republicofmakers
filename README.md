## 👤 About Me

Born in 1997 in Turkey, I’ve always been curious about how things work — a curiosity that naturally evolved into a passion for engineering and innovation.

I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Electronics Engineering** from **Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (HUFS)** in South Korea — a journey that strengthened my engineering foundation, adaptability, and global perspective.  
Nearly all of my studies were **funded through scholarships**, reflecting my dedication, discipline, and consistent academic excellence.

**Thesis:** Angle of Arrival Estimation Algorithms Using Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)  

Passionate about **electronics and embedded systems**, I focus on transforming ideas into robust hardware and software products.  
Beyond engineering, I practice **martial arts** for discipline and focus, and enjoy **3D printing** as a creative way to merge design and practical engineering.

Driven by curiosity and determination, I continually seek opportunities to **innovate, collaborate, and deliver** technology that creates real-world impact.
