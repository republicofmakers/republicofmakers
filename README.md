## ðŸ‘¤ About Me

Born in 1997 in Turkey, Iâ€™ve always been curious about how things work â€” a curiosity that naturally evolved into a passion for engineering and innovation.

I hold a **Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronics Engineering** from **Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (HUFS)** in South Korea â€” a journey that strengthened my engineering foundation, adaptability, and global perspective.  
Nearly all of my studies were **funded through scholarships**, reflecting my dedication, discipline, and consistent academic excellence.

Passionate about **electronics and embedded systems**, I focus on transforming ideas into robust hardware and software products.  
Beyond engineering, I practice **martial arts** for discipline and focus, and enjoy **3D printing** as a creative way to merge design and practical engineering.

Driven by curiosity and determination, I continually seek opportunities to **innovate, collaborate, and deliver** technology that creates real-world impact.

## ðŸ“˜ Thesis / Graduation Project

**Title:** *Angle of Arrival Estimation Algorithms Using Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)*  
**Repository:** [Thesis Project â†’](https://github.com/republicofmakers/Thesis-Angle-of-Arrival-Estimation-Algorithms-Using-Received-Signal-Strength-Indicator)

In my thesis, I developed a low-cost **Angle of Arrival (AoA)** estimation system using an **ESP32 module** with **directional antennas**.  
Key achievements include:
- Designed an **antenna multiplexer** with Pi- and L-type impedance-matching networks.  
- Tuned matching values using a **network analyzer** and **Smith chart**.  
- Implemented **C-based trigonometric algorithms** for AoA estimation.  
- Demonstrated that RSSI-based methods can deliver **scalable, cost-efficient positioning** for **logistics, healthcare, and smart infrastructure**.
